# How to use the extension

### Usage

1. Go to your Audible library
2. Click the **Audible ​Library ​Extractor** link
3. In the next view you can choose what to extract and start the extraction process by clicking the big blue button.

![The extraction will likely take a few minutes. How long it actually takes depends on the size of your library and related data.](.gitbook/assets/ale-basic-usage.gif)

{% hint style="success" %}
After the extraction is done, a new tab with the gallery is opened in its place. The gallery can be opened from the [browser's global context menu](gallery/opening-the-gallery.md) at any time after the first extraction.
{% endhint %}
