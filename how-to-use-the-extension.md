# How to use the extension

### Usage

1. Go to your Audible library
2. Click the **Audible ​Library ​Extractor** button
3. In the next view, you can choose what to extract and start the extraction process by clicking the big blue button.

{% hint style="success" %}
The gallery that opens after extraction can be opened from the [browser's global context menu](gallery/opening-the-gallery.md) at any time after the first extraction.
{% endhint %}

### Good to know...

The extension basically takes a snapshot of your current data at that moment in time, so the data is never updated automatically. If you have finished any books, started, rated or just added new books, you will have to do this extraction process again in order to view up-to-date data in the gallery. However, after extracting the data once, the extension will do a faster extraction that simply updates necessary items.

### Sharing the gallery?
