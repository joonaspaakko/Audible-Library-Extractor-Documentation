# How to use the extension

### Usage

1. Go to your Audible library
2. Click the **Audible ​Library ​Extractor** link
3. In the next view you can choose what to extract and start the extraction process by clicking the big blue button.

![The extraction will likely take a few minutes. How long it actually takes depends on the size of your library and related data.](.gitbook/assets/ale-basic-usage.gif)

{% hint style="success" %}
After the extraction is done, a new tab with the gallery is opened in its place. The gallery can be opened from the [browser's global context menu](gallery/opening-the-gallery.md) at any time after the first extraction. This context menu will also have a quick lick back to your Audible library.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The extension basically takes a snapshot of your current data at that moment in tim, so the data is never updated automatically. If you have finished any books, started, rated or just added new books, you will have to do this extraction process again in order to view up to date data in the gallery. However, after extracting the data once, the extension will do a faster extraction that simply updates necessary items.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is possible that a new extension version extracts data differently and possibly more data, so for that to affect older books you've already extracted, you should remove all data from "extraction settings", that you can see in the gif above, and that will force the next extraction to extract everything fully once more.&#x20;

If you don't do this, it's possible for the gallery to malfunction in unexpected ways and you might be missing out on some new features. That said, it's not recommended to remove extracted data and do a full extraction all the time, just once after an update should be enough.
