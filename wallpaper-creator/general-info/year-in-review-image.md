# Year in review image

With the [Wallpaper Creator](broken-reference), you can easily create a collage from your library book covers pretty easily. The best way to do this is to create a collection in Audible you keep adding books you finished and then just save an image of it.&#x20;

> Starting from v.0.2.9 there's a tier list mode that would also work for this type of image.

### Steps (also in the video)

1. Create a collection in Audible with all the books you've finished. Probably the best way would be to add books to the collection as soon as you finish, but otherwise going down the list of finished books in your library sorted by recent adding them to the collection might be the second easiest way, which I find especially easy in the mobile app.
2. [Install](../../installation/) the extension
3. Go to your audible library and start the extraction. Make sure to extract collections.
4. In the gallery, go to the collection page with the books.
5. Top right of the gallery click the wallpaper creator icon (you may want to sort before this). You can also sort manually in the editor.
6. Use the canvas preset `card`. Edit the settings any way you want...
7. Save the image using the big blue jbutton with a camera icon.

> Note: if you upload the [gallery online](../../sharing/uploading-to-github/), you can also link straight to the collection.
