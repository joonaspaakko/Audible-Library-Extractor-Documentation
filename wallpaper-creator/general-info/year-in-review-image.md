# Year in review image

With the [Wallpaper Creator](broken-reference) included in the extension you can easily create a collage from your library book covers. The best way to do a collage of the books you've listened this year is to first create a collection in Audible and then extract library data and generate the image. More instructions below...

### Steps (also in the video)

1. Create a collection in Audible with all the books you've finished. Probably the best time to add books to your collection is as soon as you finish a book, but it you haven't done that, the next best thing would probably be opening your library in the mobile app, turning on the filter "finished", making sure the default sorter "recent" is on, and adding books into the collection one by one until you reach books you didn't read this year.&#x20;
2. [Install](../../installation/) the extension
3. Go to your audible library and start the extraction. Make sure to extract collections.
4. In the gallery, go to the collection page using the top menu.
5. You open the "wallpaper creator" (image editor) from the right side of the top menu .
6. Use the canvas preset "card" or "card + tier list".&#x20;
7. <mark style="color:orange;">**Optional**</mark>: sort covers manually by dragging. You can also use the gallery sorting before opening the editor. That way you could sort by attributes like length or your rating.
8. <mark style="color:orange;">**Optional**</mark>: change the options from the right sidebar. Note: you can add text from there as well.
9. <mark style="color:orange;">**Optional**</mark>: you can mark books as re-read by first selecting a cover by clicking it, then from the top right of the canvas "mark as re-read".
10. Save the image using the big blue button with the camera icon.

> Note: if you upload the [gallery online](../../sharing/uploading-to-github/), you can also link straight to the collection.
