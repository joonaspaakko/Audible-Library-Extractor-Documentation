# Year in review image

â€‹

With the [Wallpaper Creator](broken-reference) you can create this type of image pretty easily. The time consuming part is that you need to create and fill a collection with all the books you listened to. I've been adding books in my collection about as soon as I finished them, so I haven't had to spend a lot of time making the collection in one sitting.

### Steps

1. Create a collection in Audible with all the books you've finished. Probably the best way would be to add books to the collection as soon as you finish, but otherwise going down the list of finished books in your library sorted by recent adding them to the collection might be the second easiest way, which I find especially easy in the mobile app.
2. [Install](../../installation/) the extension
3. Go to your audible library and start the extraction. Make sure to extract collections.
4. In the gallery, go to the collection page with the books.
5. Top right of the gallery click the wallpaper creator icon (you may want to sort before this). You can also sort manually in the editor.
6. Use the canvas preset `card`. Edit the settings any way you want...
7. Save the image

{% hint style="info" %}
If you upload the [gallery online](../../sharing/uploading-to-github/), you can also link straight to the collection like this: [My year so far (2021)](https://joonaspaakko.github.io/my-audible-library/#/collections/e4370436-1a86-4154-a0e6-b366d4ef88dd)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The default canvas width for the card preset is 1200px and if you increase the "covers per row" setting, the canvas width stays the same... Meaning that the more covers you fit into one row, the smaller the cover size is going to be, making it hard to read any text on the cover in some cases. So I recommend previewing the image at 100% zoom before or after saving it.&#x20;

> To make the covers bigger, just increase the canvas width, like perhaps anywhere between `2000-4000px`. There may be a point where the file size becomes too big if you make it too large. You can also scale the entire image output by enabling the "scaled output" setting at the very bottom and then increasing the zoom level.

Make sure the "Limit covers" setting includes all the books in the collection... The default for collections is 50, but if you want to save an image with more covers, it's absolutely fine to increase it.
