At this point you should have saved the animated wallpaper and extracted the .zip file into a safe location, that is hopefully not the Downloads folder so you won't accidentally remove it.

**Download** [Plash](https://sindresorhus.com/plash).

### Step 1: Add animated wallpaper

Click the menu bar item and go `Add Website...`&#x20;
