# Animated wallpapers

The editor has an **animated wallpaper mode**, in which you don't save an image, but rather an animated wallpaper that is basically a standalone website that keeps rotating the book covers indefinitely. This generated wallpaper can be used on **Windows** or **Mac** using 3rd party applications that can show websites as your desktop wallpaper. In this case they are stored locally on your computer, which is also ideal so you don't need an internet connection to run it and the page load is fast.

> There are probably similar apps for Linux, but I can't help with that.

### **Mac apps**

1. [**Plash**](https://sindresorhus.com/plash) (free) macOS 11 or later.&#x20;
   * [Instructions](plash.md) for Plash
   * There's also 10.5 compatible version in the [Plash's github repository](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Plash#download).
2. [**WebViewScreensaver**](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver) (free)&#x20;
   * To be super clear, this app allows you to set it as your screensaver and not as a wallpaper.
   * Download the .zip file from github [releases](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver/releases/latest).
   * No guide for this, but quickly, when you open the `WebViewScreenSaver.saver` , it gets added to your screensavers and you need to add a local path to the `index.html` file in the `url` input.

### **Windows apps**

1. [**Lively**](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively) (free)&#x20;
   * [Instructions](lively.md) for Lively
2. [**Wallpaper Engine**](https://www.wallpaperengine.io) (\~$4)&#x20;
   * [Instructions](wallpaper-engine.md) for Wallpaper Engine
   * This can also make the wallpaper your screensaver.

If downloading a third party app is too much, there's also the option to save a still wallpaper image instead... Of course it's not quite as cool.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The general usage in all of these kind of apps is this:

1. Save the animated wallpaper
2. Unpack the `.zip` file
3. In the third party app, locate either the unpacked .zip's folder or the index.html file inside it.
4. Activate the wallpaper if necessary.

The app specific instructions (left sidebar) have screenshots, if you get lost.
