# General info

The wallpaper creator _(since v.0.2.7)_ can be used to create a gridded collage image using book covers from your extracted data: library, wishlist, collections, categories, etc...

### Usage / cover image source

The editor can be opened from any page that has books because the editor gets the cover images from the current page. If there are no covers on the page you are on, it won't open.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if you want to save an image with covers from a specific collection, you can navigate to the collection page, and open the editor from the top right.
{% endhint %}

### **Available cover exclusion settings**

* Exclude archived books
* Limit cover images
  * You can manually sort covers by dragging them around. If you sort unwanted covers to the bottom and lower the cover cove limit, the unwanted covers will get dropped out.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can also exclude covers to a certain degree by using filters and/or searching before opening the editor. The page sorting is also retained, but you can also manually sort covers in the editor.
{% endhint %}

Use the blue circle shaped button in the sidebar to save your image or animated wallpaper.

By default images are compressed and therefore saved as **jpg**. You can choose to disable compression under the options heading **"Reduce file size"**. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to save the image with a transparent or translucent background color. Uncompressed image are saved as **png**. The reason why compression is enabled by default is that **png** files can get huge pretty fast.
