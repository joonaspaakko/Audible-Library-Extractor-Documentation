# Spreadsheet view

By default when you open the gallery you see the grid view, but there is also a spreadsheet view that is read-only. It's not meant to compete with any actual spreadsheet application, it's really just a list view for anyone who prefers to view data in this format. It has all the same features the grid view has: searching, filtering, sorting, and clicking the row opens the book details.

> You can also use the [CSV export](csv-export/) to export the gallery data and import to whatever spreadsheet application you like.

![You can toggle between the two view modes using the icon button next to the search field. This icon moves to the bottom menu in certain mobile sizes.](../.gitbook/assets/ALE-view-mode-toggle.png)

![If you click the book details open, arrow keys will help you move to another row.](../.gitbook/assets/ALE-spreadsheet-view.png)
