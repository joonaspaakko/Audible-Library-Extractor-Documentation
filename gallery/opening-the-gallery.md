# Opening the gallery

The extension adds global context menu items to your browser (since v.0.2.7), so you can right-click anywhere in an open tab, choose `Audible library extractor > Extension gallery`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are not seeing menu items `1` and `2` , it's likely because the extension doesn't have data yet. You need at least one completed extraction to see these menu items.
{% endhint %}
