# Find next listen on mobile

The gallery is available for you to use on a desktop computer immediately after extraction, but if you upload the standalone gallery online, you can show others what you have in your Audible library by sharing a link to it and it can also serve the purpose of helping you find your next listen on mobile.&#x20;

Below I've listed some key features that may not be immediately obvious, but make it really easy to use the gallery in conjunction with the Audible mobile app.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You have to upload the gallery online to use it on mobile. Check upload instructions [here](../sharing/uploading-to-github/).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This video shows all that I'm going to talk about on this page:

### Home screen icon

You can save the website as an icon on your mobile device's home screen just like any website ([instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/196087/how-to-add-websites-to-the-home-screen-on-any-smartphone-or-tablet/)). Adding the home screen icon isn't necessary, but it does make your library easier to access. The gallery will then act a lot like an app, in that it opens in a new app window rather inside the browser.

> You have to do this only once. When you update the gallery online, you may have to close the Audible Library "app" and open it again for it to refresh.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since the home screen icon is basically a glorified bookmark that saves the current address as is, you can change filtering and sorting before saving the icon and it will remember those settings when it's opened. For example, you can make the icon open your library while excluding finished books.

### Opening a book in Audible's mobile app

There's a handy dandy icon<img src="../.gitbook/assets/open-in-audible-icon.png" alt="" data-size="line">in book details that opens the book to the details page (or store page) in Audible's mobile app so you can easily start listening to the book.

{% hint style="warning" %}
On a desktop browser or when a mobile app is not available, this link will open the book's store page on the website.
{% endhint %}

### My books in the series list

This is probably my most used feature. It's great for figuring out which book is next in the series because it's basically a more compact version of the series page in Audible that also shows the status of each book so you know exactly how far you are in a series, especially in cases where you have more than one unread book in a series. More details [here](my-books-in-the-series-list.md).
