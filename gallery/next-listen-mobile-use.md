# Find next listen & mobile use

After the gallery is uploaded online, you can show others what you have in your Audible library by sharing a link to the gallery, but it can also be super useful for finding new books from your library to listen to. Using the gallery to find a book to listen to and then opening it in Audible's mobile app is very streamlined.

Below I've listed some key features that may not be immediately obvious, but make it really easy to use the gallery in conjunction with the mobile app.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You have to upload the gallery online to use it on mobile. Check upload instructions [here](../sharing/uploading-to-github/). You will also need an internet connection to use the gallery on mobile. That said, you may be able to use the Chrome extension on the [Kiwi browser](https://kiwibrowser.com) locally on Android.

### Open book in Audible's mobile app

There's a handy dandy icon<img src="../.gitbook/assets/open-in-audible-icon.png" alt="" data-size="line">in book details that opens the book to the details page (or store page) in Audible's mobile app so you can easily start listening to the book.

{% hint style="warning" %}
On a desktop browser or when a mobile app is not available, this link will open the book's store page on the website.

### My books in the series list

This is probably my most used feature. It's great for figuring out which book is next in the series. It lists all the books you have in the series in the same order they appear on Audible's series page but it also shows the status of each book, which is something you can't see in Audible's series page. More details [here](my-books-in-the-series-list.md).

Clicking a book title/row takes you to the [series subpage](https://joonaspaakko.github.io/my-audible-library/#/series/B077XNSN35) with the book details already open.

### Home screen icon

You can save the website as an icon to your mobile device's home screen just like any website ([instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/196087/how-to-add-websites-to-the-home-screen-on-any-smartphone-or-tablet/)).

Adding a home screen icon isn't necessary, but it does make it **easier to quickly open the gallery**. It **opens as a standalone **_**"app"**_, so it won't get drowned out by other tabs in the browser. Additionally, it opens **fullscreen** without an `address bar`, `back`, and `forward` button and other browser controls, as you see in the animated gif at the top of this article.&#x20;

> On **IOS** there's a confirmation that pops up when you click the open in app <img src="../.gitbook/assets/open-in-audible-icon.png" alt="" data-size="line">icon, but it's skipped when you run the website from the home screen icon. You do have to click "done" if you go back to the gallery afterwards.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since the home screen icon is basically a glorified bookmark that saves the current address as is, you can change filtering and sorting before saving the icon and it will remember those settings when it's opened. For example, you can make the icon open your library while excluding `started` and `finished` books.
