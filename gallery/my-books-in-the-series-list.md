# My books in the series list

Open book details by clicking a book cover and if the book is part of a series, it'll have this list in the sidebar (collapsed by default). This list is really useful for finding the next book in the series because the statuses are clearly indicated with icons along with some other visual cues.

* <img src="../.gitbook/assets/icon-open-in-app.jpg" alt="" data-size="original"> **Open in Audible's mobile app** _(if possible)_
* <img src="../.gitbook/assets/icon-not-started.jpg" alt="" data-size="original"> **Not started** - Clicking these books takes you to the **series sub page**.
* <img src="../.gitbook/assets/icon-started.jpg" alt="" data-size="original"> **Started** - Clicking these books takes you to the **series sub page**.
* <img src="../.gitbook/assets/icon-finished.jpg" alt="" data-size="original"> **Finished** - Clicking these books takes you to the **series sub page**.
* <img src="../.gitbook/assets/icon-not-in-library.jpg" alt="" data-size="original"> **Not in your library** - Clicking these books takes you to the **store page** in Audible.
* <img src="../.gitbook/assets/icon-in-plus-catalog.png" alt="" data-size="original"> **In plus catalog -** Clicking these books takes you to the **store page** in Audible. (since v.0.2.7)

**More info:**

* If a book is part of multiple series (according to Audible), they will all be visible in this list!
* Unfinished book rows are slightly highlighted compared to everything else that are grayed out.
* Starting from v.0.2.8 there are filters on top of this drawer that you can use to hide finished books or books you don't own.
* On a desktop computer you can hover over the icons to remind yourself of what they mean. On mobile you can click them.
