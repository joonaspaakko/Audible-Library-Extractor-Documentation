# Import / export data

Starting from v.0.2.7 you can import and export extracted data as is, meaning that you  can recover extracted data on a new computer or a new install without having to do a full extraction.&#x20;

> That said, new extraction may be preferred after installing a new version in order to extract new kind of data if there are any changes there.
